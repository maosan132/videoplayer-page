# Video Player Page

We have created a clone for the YoutubeÂ´s page, with the video functionality and the thumbnails at the right column, plus decription and comment sections. We completed the project with the help of Visual Studio Code editor, git bash, Nano, Guthub site and github desktop. We also make use of a graphic editor (Illustrator) for making the icons. We have coded this project with Html5 and css3. We also got help from other students at the stand up meeting and from slack.
